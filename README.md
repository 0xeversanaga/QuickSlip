__Automated Offense Slip System for PDSA in Liceo De Cagayan University__

## About QuickSlip:
**Purpose**: The research aims to develop "QuickSlip" an automated web and mobile application system, to digitize the distribution of offense slips and community service slips at Liceo De Cagayan University, replacing manual processes that cause delays, overcrowding, and academic disruptions.

**Developers**: The system is designed and developed by Grade 12 ICT students (ICT 3 strand), led by Ever R. Sanaga and 11 other co-researchers from Liceo De Cagayan University.

**Motivation**: The study was initiated to resolve inefficiencies in the current Prefect of Discipline and Student Affairs (PDSA) office workflow, where students waste class time waiting for physical slips, faculty face administrative burdens, and the manual system hinders transparency and timely disciplinary actions.

## TODO:

* Design the dashboard for each users.
    * Faculty, Students & Prefect of Discipline and Student Affairs (PDSA)
* Add the corresponding features for all different types of users.
    * Faculty: Barcode scanning, violation reporting
    * Students: List of offenses, reporting issue for violation(s)
    * PDSA: List of reports (faculty & students), record & verify reports, issue community service slips. 
* Relax.
